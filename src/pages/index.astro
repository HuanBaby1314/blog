      <p>
        Hi, I'm Jack Huan! A Front-end Engineer, Dad of two kids. My friends
        also call me <b>Rabbit</b> as my Chinese initials.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a front-end developer base in Shanghai, specializing in building
        web front-end applications.I previously worked at <a
          href="http://www.xglory.cn/"
          target="_blank">Xglory</a
        >, <a href="https://www.infodator.com/" target="_blank">Infodator</a> and
        <a href="https://ct.ctrip.com/" target="_blank">Trip.Biz</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôve always been a logical thinker since I was young, that‚Äôs why I
        started my career by writing some code. Coding is fun and solving
        problems is enjoyable, but it‚Äôs not everything in life. After gaining
        insight at work and making my first pot of gold, I‚Äôve got more interest
        in different things, including cooking, sports, music, cartoon, and
        more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Almost all my skills were learned online for free thanks to the
        Internet, AI models and my friend <a
          href="https://chrislin.vercel.app/"
          target="_blank">Chris Lin</a
        >. You can do it too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I live in Shanghai. If you are around, feel free to reach me
        out, we could have some coffee or work together.
