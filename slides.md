Hi, I'm Jack Huan! A Front-end Engineer, Dad of two kids. My friends also call me **Rabbit** as my Chinese initials.

I am a front-end developer base in Shanghai, specializing in building web front-end applications.I previously worked at [Xglory](http://www.xglory.cn/), [Infodator](https://www.infodator.com/) and [Trip.Biz](https://ct.ctrip.com/). 

Iâ€™ve always been a logical thinker since I was young, thatâ€™s why I started my career by writing some code. Coding is fun and solving problems is enjoyable, but itâ€™s not everything in life. After gaining insight at work and making my first pot of gold, Iâ€™ve got more interest in different things, including cooking, sports, music, cartoon, and more.

Almost all my skills were learned online for free thanks to the Internet, AI models and my friend [Chris Lin](https://chrislin.vercel.app/). You can do it too.
